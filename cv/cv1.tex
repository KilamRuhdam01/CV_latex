 \paragraph{Brief} 
 Army Leader, Travel Enthusiast.\\
Having served in the Indian Army for the last 12 years, I have perfected the art of finding opportunities in the middle of difficulties. Leading men in inhospitable terrain and tense situations is second nature. I particulary value my bonding with my men, this bonding has been my best asset in all my professional career. Not afraid to get my hands dirty. I deal with transitions and changes positively. \\
